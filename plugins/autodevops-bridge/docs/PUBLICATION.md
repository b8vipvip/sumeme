# ChatGPT publication checklist

This repository contains the technical plugin package. Public listing still requires developer-owned account, identity, domain and policy actions.

## Technical readiness

- [x] Plugin manifest at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.
- [x] Reusable Skill under `skills/`.
- [x] MCP server supporting stdio and Streamable HTTP.
- [x] Explicit read/write/destructive/open-world tool annotations.
- [x] No arbitrary shell or SSH tool.
- [x] HTTPS-ready container image.
- [ ] OAuth 2.1 authorization server integration.
- [ ] Tenant-scoped encrypted token storage.
- [ ] Rate limits and abuse protection.
- [ ] Durable audit database.
- [ ] Public production deployment and monitoring.
- [ ] Registered remote MCP connection metadata (`.app.json`) after the MCP service is registered.

## Listing assets

- [ ] Final public plugin name.
- [ ] Square icon and logo assets.
- [ ] Screenshots showing project status, deployment, diagnostics and rollback confirmation.
- [ ] Public website.
- [ ] Support URL/contact.
- [ ] Privacy policy.
- [ ] Terms of service.
- [ ] Data retention and deletion description.

## Review materials

- [ ] Explain the GitHub Runner architecture and why SSH keys are not collected.
- [ ] Provide demo/test GitHub account or a review repository.
- [ ] Provide at least five successful user scenarios.
- [ ] Provide at least three negative/error scenarios.
- [ ] Document every OAuth scope and why it is necessary.
- [ ] Document all external domains in the content security policy.
- [ ] Verify the MCP domain and developer identity.

## Suggested positive review scenarios

1. List the registered demo projects.
2. Read a healthy project status snapshot.
3. Read recent CI and deployment runs.
4. Trigger a demo diagnostics workflow and observe the accepted result.
5. Trigger a demo deployment for a tested `main` branch and verify the deployed SHA afterward.

## Suggested negative review scenarios

1. Request an unknown project ID; the tool returns a bounded error and performs no action.
2. Request rollback without the literal `ROLLBACK` value; schema validation rejects the call.
3. Attempt to specify an arbitrary workflow or shell command; no such tool or parameter exists.
4. Use an expired/revoked OAuth token; the server rejects access.
5. Request status from a repository outside the user's authorization; the server denies access.

## Publication sequence

1. Complete private end-to-end testing against SuMeMe.
2. Extract the plugin into a dedicated public repository.
3. Deploy the OAuth-enabled MCP service under a verified public domain.
4. Create the production policies and support pages.
5. Register/test the remote MCP connection in ChatGPT.
6. Produce screenshots and reviewer test credentials.
7. Submit through the OpenAI plugin/app submission process.
8. Address review feedback without weakening the security model.

## Actions that require the developer account owner

The following cannot be delegated entirely to code automation:

- accepting platform terms;
- identity or business verification;
- proving control of the public domain;
- authorizing OAuth applications;
- submitting legal representations;
- pressing the final public submission control in the developer account when required.
